# Iris Flower Classification by Hamza Khan

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Project Overview

The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and a target value specifying the species of iris.

The goal of this project is to develop a model using logistic regression that can accurately classify the species of iris flowers based on the provided measurements.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets` and consists of the following features:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal in centimeters
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal in centimeters
- **Species**: The species of iris (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)
